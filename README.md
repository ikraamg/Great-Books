# Great Shorts - The community-driven short-story sharing site

- This site is a community-driven short-story sharing site that allows users to write and upvote their favourite stories.

- The application has Google and Github (OmniAuth) sign in options in addition to a standard login.

- Built in Ruby on Rails: A user can create, edit, delete and upvote articles.

- The short-stories are categorized into various genres and links to each category can be found on the homepage bottom blocks which feature the most recent story written for the genre.

- The story with the most number of votes is displayed in the large featured section of the homepage.

- Categories can be created/updated/deleted via the admin account (admin@admin.com). The top 4 prioritised catagories are displayed in the top-links and homepage.

- RSpec and Capybara were used to run the unit and integration tests.

- The 'bullet-gem' was used to identify cases of N+1 queries. N+1 queries were removed when found and unnecessary eager loading was also minimized.

- Active Storage with Amazon s3 was used instead of local image storage as images don't persist on heroku free deployments.

## Live Demo and Presentation

- The project was deployed on Heroku: [Live Demo Link](https://great-books-site.herokuapp.com/)

## Built With

- Ruby 2.6.5 and Rails 5.2.4.2
- Bootstrap 4
- Deployed on Heroku

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Ruby: 2.6.3
- Rails: 5.2.3
- Postgres: >=9.5
- Git

### Usage

- Fork/Clone this project to your local machine and checkout to required branch:

```Bash
    git clone git@github.com:ikraamg/Great-Books.git
    cd Great-Books
    git checkout core-feature
```

#### Install gems with

```Ruby
    bundle install
```

Thereafter, delete the `config/credentials.yml.enc` file.

#### OmniAuth Setup

Please note that the OmniAuth via Google and GitHub will not work on another deployment unless the API credentials are set up in Rails.

If you are **NOT** using Google or GitHub sign in methods, then overite as done below inside /Great-Books/config/initializers/devise.rb file.

```Ruby
#Great-Books/config/initializers/devise.rb

# github_client_id =  Rails.application.credentials.github[:client_id]
# github_client_secret = Rails.application.credentials.github[:client_secret]

# google_client_id = Rails.application.credentials.google_oauth2[:client_id]
# google_client_secret = Rails.application.credentials.google_oauth2[:client_secret]

github_client_id = 'empty-key'
github_client_secret = 'empty-key'

google_client_id = 'empty-key'
google_client_secret = 'empty-key'
```

If you are **optionally** using the Google and GitHub sign-in then:
Please follow [this guide](https://johnofsydney.github.io/notes/rails/rails_social_login.html#register-your-app-with-github-and-google) to get the credentials.

[This section](https://johnofsydney.github.io/notes/rails/rails_social_login.html#encrypted-credentials-1) will explain how to enter the credentials into the app.

#### Active Storage Setup

If you are **NOT** using AWS S3 Buckets for active storage, you also need to use the local storage for image files instead of AWS:

1. Change **line 31** in config/environments/development.rb and **line 38** in config/environments/production.rb to:

```Ruby
#config/environments/development.rb
#config/environments/production.rb
config.active_storage.service = :local
```

2. Comment out lines 8 to 23 in config/storage.yml.

```Ruby
#config/storage.yml
# amazon_dev:
#   service: S3
#   access_key_id: <%= Rails.application.credentials.aws[:access_key_id] %>
#   secret_access_key:
#     <%= Rails.application.credentials.aws[:secret_access_key] %>
#   region: <%= Rails.application.credentials.aws[:region] %>
#   bucket: <%= Rails.application.credentials.aws[:dev][:bucket] %>

# amazon_prod:
#   service: S3
#   access_key_id: <%= Rails.application.credentials.aws[:access_key_id] %>
#   secret_access_key:
#     <%= Rails.application.credentials.aws[:secret_access_key] %>
#   region: <%= Rails.application.credentials.aws[:region] %>
#   bucket: <%= Rails.application.credentials.aws[:prod][:bucket] %>
```

If you are **optionally** using AWS S3 buckets for active storage, please follow this [tutorial](https://medium.com/@iachieve80/rails-6-0-upload-images-using-active-storage-and-amazon-simple-storage-service-amazon-s3-36861c03dc4a)(skipping the 'Setting up Active Storage' section).

#### Setup database with

```Ruby
    yarn install --check-files
    rails db:create
    rails db:migrate
```

#### Start server with

```Ruby
    rails server
```

### Running tests

```Ruby
    bundle exec RSpec --format documentation
```

- Open a web page and go to [port 3000 on your local machine.](http://localhost:3000)

### Deployment

The application was deployed on Heroku.
To deploy your own copy, you can follow the following [steps:](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git)
To allow Heroku to access the encrpyted api keys, use this command in your Heroku connected CLI:

```Ruby
heroku config:set RAILS_MASTER_KEY= <master.key>
```

(The master key can be found in the `/config/master.key` file)
